**Project Title:** Evaluating the Impact of Wearable Watches on Fitness

**Description:** The purpose of this project is to identify technological advancements as a key driver behind the boom in the fitness industry. Specifically, we have found that wearable devices, such as smartwatches, play a significant role in enhancing fitness by helping users monitor and improve their health. Among these devices, the Apple Watch and Fitbit are two leading options. Our goal is to guide consumers in selecting the most suitable smartwatch to support their fitness goals and needs. 

**Hypothesis**
●  Null Hypothesis: There is no significant improvement by less than 5% in the fitness world such as in one person's weight either using an Apple Watch or using a Fitbit.
●  Alternative Hypothesis: There is a significant improvement by more than 5% in the fitness world such as one person's weight either using an Apple Watch or using a Fitbit.

**Research Question:**
How do the Apple Watch and Fitbit compare in their effectiveness and impact on fitness outcomes, and what factors should consumers consider when choosing between these devices for their health and fitness goals?

**Conclution**
Our thorough analysis of the comprehensive data confirms that our hypothesis has been addressed. 
  Null Hypothesis: There is no significant improvement by less than 5% in the fitness world such as in one person's weight either using an Apple Watch or using a Fitbit.
  Hypothesis: There is a significant improvement by more than 5% in the fitness world such as one person's weight either using an Apple Watch or using a Fitbit.
An intriguing observation from our analysis is that Apple Watch users exhibit 8.63% higher intensity in physical activity compared to Fitbit users. This suggests that Apple Watch users are more vigorous in their workouts. However, despite this higher intensity, Fitbit users tend to burn more calories over time. Consequently, it can be inferred that Fitbit users may experience greater improvements in weight management in the long run, even though Apple Watch users are more intense in their gym activities.
In understanding this data we acknowledged that lying down was an activity listed in the data frame if more time was allowed we would have placed a different activity to track more of a fitness aspect rather than a activity that takes little to no effort to do.
